Hi 👋 my name is Vike and I'm a 25 year old that lives in Brisbane, Australia.
I work as a software engineer remotely for a large tech company based in the US where I develop software that is used by millions of people every day.

Outside of work I play competitive Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and am one of the admins at [MarioKartCentral](https://mkc.gg/).
I am also the developer of the [150cc Lounge website](https://www.mk8dx-lounge.com).

If you would like to contact me you can reach me on Discord (Vike#9470) or Twitter ([@VikeMK](https://twitter.com/VikeMK))
